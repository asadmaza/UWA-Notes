# Read Me

I shared my notes recently with a few people and they really liked my note taking style. There is a combination of my own input and AI, so please use it at your own risk. Commercial use is prohibited, please attribute or link my work to others, I hope you find it useful.

Feel free to reach out to me if you have any questions. Goodluck with your studies!

*P.S. These notes are from units under the Master of Information Technology/Software Engineering/Business Analytics courses at the University of Western Australia.*
