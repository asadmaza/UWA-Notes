# Tips

I recommend downloading the `md` files and then importing into [Obsidian](https://obsidian.md/) with a [theme](https://help.obsidian.md/Extending+Obsidian/Themes) of your choice to take your notes to another level ✈️.
You can export these as PDF through Obsidian, below is an example of what your notes could look like, my theme here is Blue Topaz:
